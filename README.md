# Testing Practices :coffee:

## Overview
This project is dedicated to practicing and mastering testing techniques in the Spring Framework.

## Objectives
- **Understand the principles of unit testing** in Spring applications.
- **Implement integration tests** to validate the interaction between components.
- **Explore various testing tools** and frameworks available in the Spring ecosystem.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- `src/main/java`: Contains the main application code.
- `src/test/java`: Contains test classes for unit and integration tests.

## Testing Focus Areas

### Unit Testing
- **Purpose**: Test individual methods and components in isolation.
- **Tools**: Utilizing JUnit and Mockito to mock dependencies and assert expected behaviors.
- **Practice**: Writing tests for service classes, controllers, and utility functions.

### Integration Testing
- **Purpose**: Test the interactions between multiple components, including database and external services.
- **Tools**: Using `@SpringBootTest` and `TestRestTemplate` to run tests that involve the complete application context.
- **Practice**: Validating API endpoints and ensuring data consistency in the database.
